# CUDA_devel
This folder contains CUDA code for developing pruned 1D, 2D and 3D FFTs on GPUs. FFTs are computed for irregular domains of the given signal. The goal is to perform large 3D FFTs on constrained memory resources of a GPU by processing different parts of the signal. Code is still in developmental stages.
